# onlinesales_sql
Database and Table Creation: You are creating a new database named sales_db and then creating a table within it called online_sales. This table is structured to store various details about sales orders, including order_id, amount, profit, quantity, category, sub_category, and payment_mode.

Data Loading: You are loading data from a CSV file named Details.csv into the online_sales table. This process populates your table with the sales records from the file.

Data Inspection: You are performing a quick check by selecting and displaying the first 5 rows of the online_sales table to ensure that the data was loaded correctly.

Table Modification: You are adding a new column named order_date to the online_sales table to store the date of each order.

Data Analysis: You are performing an aggregated analysis to understand your sales performance over time. The query calculates the total revenue (total_revenue) and the total number of orders (order_volume) for each month and year, providing a monthly summary of your sales activity.
